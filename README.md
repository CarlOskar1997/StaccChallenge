## Task description
I chose to look at the backend part of the assignment. 
> I have implemented a system using python to access the JSON file and extract the information of each account object. I have also implemented the possibility to add new accounts in order to update the file. Started to work on a method of setting up personal milestones, the idea is to create new eleements in the json objects in order to run a check on wheter or not the milestones are reacehed. A rough draft of this idea is done using the function annual_savings_check which loops through the accounts in order to find who have reached the different milestones. 

## How to run
Simple program, requires a JSON file for accounts and a JSON file for transactions. The program is run entirely in python. 

## Comments
Due to a lack of time on my part the program is less detailed than I would like. I am however pleased with the core functionality which is to check in to a database of accounts and altering it.
